            <p>The God of War himself, Kratos, obviously ranks number one as a fan favorite. All fathers out there know how hard it is to raise a child. Kratos shows his fierce and undying love for his son, Atreus; he's willing to do everything in order to redeem himself from his past mistakes by leading his son to go from a simple boy to a better warrior. When  asked if he's willing to let his son kill him in order for the benefit of his son he doesn't hesitate and simply says "yes". </p>

            <p>This is Atreus. The son of Kratos is beloved by everyone in the communtiy. This small character will do everything to impress his father by excelling in the battlefield and helping with the many important puzzles throughout the game. A favorite quote of mine is "Father? Why did you leave your home and come here? Does it have to do with the other gods there? It's just... you hate the gods so much. But TÃ½r proves that gods can be good and you're good. You only killed those deserving, right?" This quote helps him shape his character as a god, giant, and most importantly a human.    </p>

            <p>Being a part of the traveling company of Kratos and his son, Mimir becomes something of a balancing force between them, teaching Atreus to use his abilities for good and often advising Kratos to be more open about the truth of his past. To that end, Mimir demonstrates that he is emotionally sensitive and insightful to the potential impact that Kratos's distant attitude towards Atreus could have but respects Kratos's wishes and doesn't inform Atreus himself. He also was the first to notice the dark change in Atreus's behavior once he finally learned of his godly heritage and thus tried to instill the ideals that figures like Tyr stood for, using one's powers with wisdom and for good. When this shift in behavior began to fracture the already tense bond between Atreus and Kratos, Mimir did his best to address the issue carefully.</p>

            <p>Cory Barlog, the director of God of War, is well respected in the gaming communtiy. He worked around the clock to make the lastest work of art: God of War. He explains that he had to reinvent the series to bring it back up to popularity and his success shows that it was all worth it. While he was working on the new production of God of War he found himself making the script for the prequel of the game. His imagination and his ability to think so far outside the box is what makes his games so loved in the world. </p>
